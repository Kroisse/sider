Roadmap
=======

Sider is planning to provide a lot of things able to be done with Redis.
It will be a long-running project, and planned features have their
priority.


Version 0.2
-----------

Transactions
   The key feature Sider 0.2 ship will be a transaction support.
   It has been being developed in the branch :branch`transaction`.

Sorted sets (:class:`sider.sortedset`)
   Redis sorted sets will be mapped to an interface like
   :class:`collections.Counter` but with slightly different behavior.
   The branch name for this will be :branch:`sortedset`.

:class:`sider.types.Tuple` type
   It could be used for storing ad-hoc composite types.
   The branch name for this will be :branch:`types-tuple`.
